# ham-radio-cli-dashboard

The idea here is create a Command Line Interface (CLI) dashboard that could be used as Ham operator utility in old computers, without need of graphics card, high memory or processing. Remember that old unused netbook in the middle of your shaft? You can use it to display information about RF, Weather, QTH etc.
